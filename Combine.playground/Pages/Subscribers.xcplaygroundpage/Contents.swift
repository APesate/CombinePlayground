# Subscribers
`Subscriber<Input, Failure>`

A `Subscriber` is a protocol that defines an object that can receive a stream of elements from a Publisher, along with life cycle events describing changes to their relationship.

It has two associated types:
- Input: type of value that can receive.
- Failure: If any, the type of error that could receive.

There are two subscribers built-in to Combine:
- Sink
- Assign

- Note: A given subscriberâ€™s Input and Failure associated types must match the Output and Failure of its corresponding publisher.

Creates a subscriber used to update a property on a KVO compliant object.
- Note: Only handles data, and expects all errors or failures to be handled in the pipeline before it is invoked.
+ Note: The type of `KeyPath` required for the assign operator is important. It requires a `ReferenceWritableKeyPath`, which is different from both `WritableKeyPath` and `KeyPath`.

# Cancellables

A protocol indicating that an activity or action supports cancellation.

Subscribers can support cancellation, which terminates a subscription and shuts down all the stream processing prior to any Completion sent by the publisher. Both Assign and Sink conform to the `Cancellable protocol`. Calling `cancel() `frees up any allocated resources.

- Important: When you are storing a reference to your own subscriber in order to clean up later, you generally want a reference to cancel the subscription. `AnyCancellable` provides a type-erased reference that converts any subscriber to the type `AnyCancellable`, allowing the use of `.cancel()` on that reference, but not access to the subscription itself (which could, for instance, request more data). It is important to store a reference to the subscriber, as when the reference is deallocated it will implicitly cancel its operation.
